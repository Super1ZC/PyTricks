print(test)

#The output is {True:'maybe'}
#This answer is amazing and it is based on the situation:
# True == 1 == 1.0 !!!!!important

#The progress happens like
#1: test = dict()
#2: test[True] = 'yes'
#3: test[1] = 'no'
#4ï¼š test[1.0] = 'maybe'
#Due to the fact that 'True == 1 == 1.0',it is equal to 
#3: test[True] = 'no'
#4: test[True] ='maybe'

#As a resultl, you can also get this ['yes','no','maybe'][True]
#The output is 'no'

#This happens because the boolean type is a subtype of the ingeter type
#and bollean values behave like the values 0 and 1.

#The key is still True because Python's dictionaries don't update the
#key object itself when a new value is associated with it.
#ys = {1.0:'no'}
#ys[True] = 'yes'
#print(ys) ----->   {1.0:'yes'}
